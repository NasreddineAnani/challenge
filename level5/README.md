# Run code

I did the challenge with Python3 because I don't know ruby yet :)

You need to install the latest version of python (3.7 or above) 
and inside the levels folder run

``python3 Main.py``


# Level 5

Some drivers want to be able to buy additionnal features after their booking.

Here are the possible options:
- GPS: 5€/day, all the money goes to the owner
- Baby Seat: 2€/day, all the money goes to the owner
- Additional Insurance: 10€/day, all the money goes to Drivy

_This is the final level, now would be a good time to tidy up your code and do a last round of refactoring :)_
